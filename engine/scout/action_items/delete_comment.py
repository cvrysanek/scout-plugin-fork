"""Delete a comment sub-bullet beneath an action item.

The inverse of `add_comment` — removes a single `  - <author>: <text>`
line attached to the matched task. Git history is the archive.

Selection rules:
- The task is resolved by `by_id` (preferred) or `by_subject` (legacy
  fallback), same contract as the other mutators.
- The comment within that task is selected by 1-based `index` (counts
  user-authored sub-bullets, skipping the `snoozed-until` marker) or by
  case-insensitive substring `text`. Exactly one must be provided.

Returns an `Event` describing the mutation.
