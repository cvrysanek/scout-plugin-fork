"""Append a comment beneath an action item.

Inserts a ``  - <author>: <comment>`` sub-bullet directly beneath the
matched task line. The task itself stays in place — the sub-bullet is
the comment. The ``<author>:`` prefix is what binds the line to the
comment-thread reader (``render.py`` and ``_common.py``); without it the
line is indistinguishable from a plain detail bullet and renders as a
detached section note. See scout-plugin#100.

``author`` defaults to ``"scout"`` (the CLI/automation writer); the GUI
passes the signed-in user's display name via ``--author`` so the comment
is attributed to a person (e.g. ``- Vaclav Nosek: ...``).

Returns an `Event` describing the mutation. v0.4 mutators emit Events
but nothing persists them yet; v0.5 will add the SQLite event store.
See v0.4 spec §13.2.
