"""Materialize today's daily action-items file from the most recent prior day.

Daily-file completeness invariant: once ``action-items-<today>.md`` exists it
must contain the full carried-forward item list — never a stub that points at
a previous day's file. Companion surfaces (scout-app, the TUI) render the
daily file as the whole truth, so a pointer makes every open item invisible
until the next briefing rewrites the file. The motivating incident
(mistake-audit Pattern #110): a lightweight auxiliary session was the day's
first writer and created a partial file whose "all other items" section said
"carry forward in full from yesterday — see that file", while the morning
briefing — delayed because the host slept through its slot — took another
half hour to rewrite it; the user opened the app inside that window and saw a
5-item stub instead of ~100 open items.

This module is the deterministic backstop: a verbatim copy of the newest
prior daily file (looking back up to ``LOOKBACK_DAYS``) under a fresh date
header and a provisional banner. No LLM involved, idempotent (no-op when
today's file exists), and quiet when there is nothing to do — runner
preambles invoke it best-effort before every session.
