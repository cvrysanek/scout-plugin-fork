"""Snooze an action item until a future date.

Inserts a ``  - snoozed-until: YYYY-MM-DD`` sub-bullet directly beneath
the matched task line. The task itself stays in place — the sub-bullet
is the snooze marker. v0.5+ list/render layers may filter out items
whose snooze marker is in the future.

Returns an `Event` describing the mutation. v0.4 mutators emit Events
but nothing persists them yet; v0.5 will add the SQLite event store.
See v0.4 spec §13.2.
