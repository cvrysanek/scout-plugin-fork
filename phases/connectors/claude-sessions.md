## Claude Sessions Outbound Scan — What {{USER_NAME}} Worked On

Scan recent Claude Code sessions to understand what {{USER_NAME}} worked on with AI assistance. This catches work that may not appear in other connectors — code written but not yet committed, research done, documents drafted, bugs debugged, or plans created.

### Find Recent Sessions

```bash
# Find session files modified in the last 24 hours
find ~/.claude/projects -name "*.jsonl" -mtime -1 2>/dev/null
```

### Scan Session History

```bash
# Quick scan of recent user prompts with project context
tail -50 ~/.claude/history.jsonl 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "
import sys, json
for line in sys.stdin:
    try:
        d = json.loads(line)
        proj = d.get('project', '?').split('/')[-1][:30]
        print(f\"{d['timestamp']} | {proj} | {d['display'][:100]}\")
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError):
        pass
"
```

### What to Look For

Session history reveals what {{USER_NAME}} spent time on. Common patterns:

- **PRs created or worked on** — if {{USER_NAME}} used Claude to help with a PR, the PR likely exists (cross-check with GitHub). The action item for that work may be Done or In Progress.
- **Bugs debugged** — if {{USER_NAME}} was debugging something, the bug may now be fixed. Check for commits or PR activity.
- **Documents written** — if {{USER_NAME}} drafted a document or proposal, it may have been sent or shared (check email, Drive, Slack).
- **Research completed** — if {{USER_NAME}} was researching a topic, the research phase of that action item may be Done.
- **Code reviewed** — if {{USER_NAME}} used Claude to help review code, that review may have been submitted (check GitHub).
- **Plans created** — if {{USER_NAME}} made implementation plans, the underlying work may be starting or in progress.

### Matching Sessions to Action Items

For each session activity found:
1. Identify which project or action item it relates to
2. Check if the work resulted in a tangible output (commit, PR, message, document)
3. If a corresponding action item exists, update its status based on the session evidence
4. If the session reveals new work not yet tracked, note it as context for the consolidation

This connector catches the gap between "{{USER_NAME}} worked on something" and "the output appeared in another system." Work done in Claude sessions often shows up in GitHub, email, or Slack shortly after — but during consolidation, the session may be the earliest signal of completed or in-progress work.

### Hard Gate — Multi-Session Repo Activity Must Reach the Action Items

If the session scan shows **≥3 sessions in the same repo since the last run**, the action items MUST reference that work — as completed (✅ with the PR/commit/merge evidence), in-progress (what's next), or blocked (state the blocker). If none of the existing action items connect to it, create one. A run that surfaces multi-session repo activity but produces an action-items file with no mention of it is a failed run: the heaviest observed work signal of the window went unacknowledged.

### Remote-Session Limitation

Web, desktop-app, and remote-agent sessions are NOT locally accessible — there is no API for their transcripts. Only their *committed outputs* are visible (via `git log`). If {{USER_NAME}} did relevant work in a remote session and didn't commit, it is invisible to this scan — never treat "no local session found" as "no work happened." When in doubt, ask {{USER_NAME}} rather than asserting a negative.

### Uncommitted Working-Tree Sweep

A session may have changed files that were never committed — invisible to `git log` and to GitHub. For each repo a session touched, also check the working tree so "in progress" vs "done" is grounded:

```bash
cd <repo> && git status --porcelain && git log --since='<last-run-time>' --oneline
```

### Narrate {{INSTANCE_NAME}}'s Own Development

{{INSTANCE_NAME}} maintains its own codebase, and {{USER_NAME}}'s work *on the system itself* is a real signal the standard connector scans miss — those scans target {{USER_NAME}}'s work product (the repos and trackers tied to projects), not the instance's own development. So commits and PRs against the engine/plugin or a companion app, and sessions spent building {{INSTANCE_NAME}}, go invisible unless swept explicitly.

The vault's own git delta is already narrated (see the Git Setup phase). Extend the **same treatment to the instance's other repositories** — an engine/plugin checkout, a desktop or mobile app — each run:

```bash
# For each instance-owned dev repo (read from this instance's configuration, not hardcoded):
git -C <repo> log --since='<last-run-time>' --oneline --shortstat
```

Narrate the deltas in the run summary, and surface an instance-owned PR that's open and waiting on review (or stale ≥48h) in the action items just as a work-product PR would be. **Parameterize the repo set** — read it from this instance's configuration; never hardcode an absolute user path or a specific private-repo name. An instance whose only repo is its vault simply relies on the vault narration.

### Claim Gate — No "Actively Building X" Without a Cited Signal

Do not assert that {{USER_NAME}} "is actively building / working on X" unless you can cite a concrete signal: a session JSONL with matching prompts, a commit SHA, an open PR, or dirty working-tree files. A session *title* or a single prompt is weak evidence — tie the claim to the tangible artifact, or downgrade it to "{{USER_NAME}} opened a session about X" rather than asserting active work.
